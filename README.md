DarkRobot was developed by me at 2008. This is a third person single player or multiplayer shooter about a big robots war. A player controls a robot which runs around the planet and shoot enemys with rockets.
I was using C++ and DarkGDK engine to develop this game.
DarkGDK is a free game engine was developed by The Game Creators company.
